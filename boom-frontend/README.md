## Summary about `utils` folder

- **Empty `utils` is normal early on.**  
- Itâ€™s a future-proof folder to keep shared helper functions to avoid duplication.  
- When you start needing reusable pure functions or formatters, put them there.

If you want, I can help you create some initial utility functions (like date formatting or video URL parsers) to put inside `utils` â€” just ask!
